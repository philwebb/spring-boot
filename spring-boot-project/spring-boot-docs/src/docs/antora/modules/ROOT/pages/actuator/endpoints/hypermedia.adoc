= Hypermedia for Actuator Web Endpoints
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

A "`discovery page`" is added with links to all the endpoints.
The "`discovery page`" is available on `/actuator` by default.

To disable the "`discovery page`", add the following property to your application properties:

[source,yaml,indent=0,subs="verbatim",configprops,configblocks]
----
	management:
	  endpoints:
	    web:
	      discovery:
	        enabled: false
----

When a custom management context path is configured, the "`discovery page`" automatically moves from `/actuator` to the root of the management context.
For example, if the management context path is `/management`, the discovery page is available from `/management`.
When the management context path is set to `/`, the discovery page is disabled to prevent the possibility of a clash with other mappings.
