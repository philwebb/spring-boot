= Using @ConfigurationProperties-annotated Types

This style of configuration works particularly well with the `SpringApplication` external YAML configuration, as shown in the following example:

[source,yaml,indent=0,subs="verbatim"]
----
	my:
	  service:
	    remote-address: 192.168.1.1
	    security:
	      username: "admin"
	      roles:
	      - "USER"
	      - "ADMIN"
----

To work with `@ConfigurationProperties` beans, you can inject them in the same way as any other bean, as shown in the following example:

include-code::./MyService[]

TIP: Using `@ConfigurationProperties` also lets you generate metadata files that can be used by IDEs to offer auto-completion for your own keys.
See the xref:appendix/configuration-metadata.adoc[appendix] for details.
