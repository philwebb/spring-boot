= Configuring System Environment Properties
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

Spring Boot supports setting a prefix for environment properties.
This is useful if the system environment is shared by multiple Spring Boot applications with different configuration requirements.
The prefix for system environment properties can be set directly on `SpringApplication`.

For example, if you set the prefix to `input`, a property such as `remote.timeout` will also be resolved as `input.remote.timeout` in the system environment.
