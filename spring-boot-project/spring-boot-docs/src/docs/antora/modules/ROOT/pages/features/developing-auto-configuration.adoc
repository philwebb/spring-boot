= Creating Your Own Auto-configuration
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

If you work in a company that develops shared libraries, or if you work on an open-source or commercial library, you might want to develop your own auto-configuration.
Auto-configuration classes can be bundled in external jars and still be picked up by Spring Boot.

Auto-configuration can be associated to a "`starter`" that provides the auto-configuration code as well as the typical libraries that you would use with it.
We first cover what you need to know to build your own auto-configuration and then we move on to the xref:features/developing-auto-configuration/custom-starter.adoc[typical steps required to create a custom starter].
