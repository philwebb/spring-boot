= Log Format
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

The default log output from Spring Boot resembles the following example:

[indent=0]
----
include::{logging-format-output}[]
----

The following items are output:

* Date and Time: Millisecond precision and easily sortable.
* Log Level: `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`, or `TRACE`.
* Process ID.
* A `---` separator to distinguish the start of actual log messages.
* Thread name: Enclosed in square brackets (may be truncated for console output).
* Logger name: This is usually the source class name (often abbreviated).
* The log message.

NOTE: Logback does not have a `FATAL` level.
It is mapped to `ERROR`.
