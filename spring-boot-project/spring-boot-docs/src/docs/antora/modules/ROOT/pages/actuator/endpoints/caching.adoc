= Configuring Endpoints
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

Endpoints automatically cache responses to read operations that do not take any parameters.
To configure the amount of time for which an endpoint caches a response, use its `cache.time-to-live` property.
The following example sets the time-to-live of the `beans` endpoint's cache to 10 seconds:

[source,yaml,indent=0,subs="verbatim",configprops,configblocks]
----
	management:
	  endpoint:
	    beans:
	      cache:
	        time-to-live: "10s"
----

NOTE: The `management.endpoint.<name>` prefix uniquely identifies the endpoint that is being configured.
