= Use a Traditional persistence.xml File
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

Spring Boot will not search for or use a `META-INF/persistence.xml` by default.
If you prefer to use a traditional `persistence.xml`, you need to define your own `@Bean` of type `LocalEntityManagerFactoryBean` (with an ID of '`entityManagerFactory`') and set the persistence unit name there.

See {spring-boot-autoconfigure-module-code}/orm/jpa/JpaBaseConfiguration.java[`JpaBaseConfiguration`] for the default settings.
