= Detecting Web Application Type

If Spring MVC is available, a regular MVC-based application context is configured.
If you have only Spring WebFlux, we will detect that and configure a WebFlux-based application context instead.

If both are present, Spring MVC takes precedence.
If you want to test a reactive web application in this scenario, you must set the configprop:spring.main.web-application-type[] property:

include::code:MyWebFluxTests[]
