= Spring Data JDBC

Spring Data includes repository support for JDBC and will automatically generate SQL for the methods on `CrudRepository`.
For more advanced queries, a `@Query` annotation is provided.

Spring Boot will auto-configure Spring Data's JDBC repositories when the necessary dependencies are on the classpath.
They can be added to your project with a single dependency on `spring-boot-starter-data-jdbc`.
If necessary, you can take control of Spring Data JDBC's configuration by adding the `@EnableJdbcRepositories` annotation or a `JdbcConfiguration` subclass to your application.

TIP: For complete details of Spring Data JDBC, see the {spring-data-jdbc-docs}[reference documentation].
