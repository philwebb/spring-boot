If you need to build an `ApplicationContext` hierarchy (multiple contexts with a parent/child relationship) or if you prefer using a "`fluent`" builder API, you can use the `SpringApplicationBuilder`.

The `SpringApplicationBuilder` lets you chain together multiple method calls and includes `parent` and `child` methods that let you create a hierarchy, as shown in the following example:

include::code:MyApplication[tag=*]

NOTE: There are some restrictions when creating an `ApplicationContext` hierarchy.
For example, Web components *must* be contained within the child context, and the same `Environment` is used for both parent and child contexts.
See the {spring-boot-module-api}/builder/SpringApplicationBuilder.html[`SpringApplicationBuilder` Javadoc] for full details.
