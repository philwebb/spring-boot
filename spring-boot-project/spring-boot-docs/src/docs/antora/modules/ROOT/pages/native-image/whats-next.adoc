If you want to learn more about the ahead-of-time processing provided by our build plugins, see the xref:maven-plugin:index.adoc[Maven] and xref:gradle-plugin:index.adoc[Gradle] plugin documentation.
To learn more about the APIs used to perform the processing, browse the `org.springframework.aot.generate` and `org.springframework.beans.factory.aot` packages of the Spring Framework sources.

For known limitations with Spring and GraalVM, please see the {github-wiki}/Spring-Boot-with-GraalVM[Spring Boot wiki].
