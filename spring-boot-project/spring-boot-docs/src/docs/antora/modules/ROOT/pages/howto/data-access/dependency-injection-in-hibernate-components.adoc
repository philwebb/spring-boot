= Use Dependency Injection in Hibernate Components

By default, Spring Boot registers a `BeanContainer` implementation that uses the `BeanFactory` so that converters and entity listeners can use regular dependency injection.

You can disable or tune this behavior by registering a `HibernatePropertiesCustomizer` that removes or changes the `hibernate.resource.beans.container` property.
