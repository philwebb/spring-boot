= Third-party Configuration

As well as using `@ConfigurationProperties` to annotate a class, you can also use it on public `@Bean` methods.
Doing so can be particularly useful when you want to bind properties to third-party components that are outside of your control.

To configure a bean from the `Environment` properties, add `@ConfigurationProperties` to its bean registration, as shown in the following example:

include::code:ThirdPartyConfiguration[]

Any JavaBean property defined with the `another` prefix is mapped onto that `AnotherComponent` bean in manner similar to the preceding `SomeProperties` example.
