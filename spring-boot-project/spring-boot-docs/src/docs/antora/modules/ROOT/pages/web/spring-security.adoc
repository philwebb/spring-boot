[[web.security]]
= Spring Security

If {spring-security}[Spring Security] is on the classpath, then web applications are secured by default.
Spring Boot relies on Spring Securityâ€™s content-negotiation strategy to determine whether to use `httpBasic` or `formLogin`.
To add method-level security to a web application, you can also add `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity` with your desired settings.
Additional information can be found in the {spring-security-docs}/servlet/authorization/method-security.html[Spring Security Reference Guide].

The default `UserDetailsService` has a single user.
The user name is `user`, and the password is random and is printed at WARN level when the application starts, as shown in the following example:

[indent=0]
----
	Using generated security password: 78fa095d-3f4c-48b1-ad50-e24c31d5cf35

	This generated password is for development use only. Your security configuration must be updated before running your application in production.
----

NOTE: If you fine-tune your logging configuration, ensure that the `org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.security` category is set to log `WARN`-level messages.
Otherwise, the default password is not printed.

You can change the username and password by providing a `spring.security.user.name` and `spring.security.user.password`.

The basic features you get by default in a web application are:

* A `UserDetailsService` (or `ReactiveUserDetailsService` in case of a WebFlux application) bean with in-memory store and a single user with a generated password (see {spring-boot-module-api}/autoconfigure/security/SecurityProperties.User.html[`SecurityProperties.User`] for the properties of the user).
* Form-based login or HTTP Basic security (depending on the `Accept` header in the request) for the entire application (including actuator endpoints if actuator is on the classpath).
* A `DefaultAuthenticationEventPublisher` for publishing authentication events.

You can provide a different `AuthenticationEventPublisher` by adding a bean for it.
