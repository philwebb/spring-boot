= Registering Custom Metrics
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

To register custom metrics, inject `MeterRegistry` into your component:

include-code::./MyBean[]

If your metrics depend on other beans, we recommend that you use a `MeterBinder` to register them:

include-code::./MyMeterBinderConfiguration[]

Using a `MeterBinder` ensures that the correct dependency relationships are set up and that the bean is available when the metric's value is retrieved.
A `MeterBinder` implementation can also be useful if you find that you repeatedly instrument a suite of metrics across components or applications.

NOTE: By default, metrics from all `MeterBinder` beans are automatically bound to the Spring-managed `MeterRegistry`.
