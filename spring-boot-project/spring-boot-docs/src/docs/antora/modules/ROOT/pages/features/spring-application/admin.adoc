It is possible to enable admin-related features for the application by specifying the configprop:spring.application.admin.enabled[] property.
This exposes the {spring-boot-module-code}/admin/SpringApplicationAdminMXBean.java[`SpringApplicationAdminMXBean`] on the platform `MBeanServer`.
You could use this feature to administer your Spring Boot application remotely.
This feature could also be useful for any service wrapper implementation.

TIP: If you want to know on which HTTP port the application is running, get the property with a key of `local.server.port`.
