= Using Spock to Test Spring Boot Applications
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

Spock 2.2 or later can be used to test a Spring Boot application.
To do so, add a dependency on a `-groovy-4.0` version of Spock's `spock-spring` module to your application's build.
`spock-spring` integrates Spring's test framework into Spock.
See https://spockframework.org/spock/docs/2.2-M1/modules.html#_spring_module[the documentation for Spock's Spring module] for further details.
