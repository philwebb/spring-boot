= Auto-configured REST Clients
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

You can use the `@RestClientTest` annotation to test REST clients.
By default, it auto-configures Jackson, GSON, and Jsonb support, configures a `RestTemplateBuilder`, and adds support for `MockRestServiceServer`.
Regular `@Component` and `@ConfigurationProperties` beans are not scanned when the `@RestClientTest` annotation is used.
`@EnableConfigurationProperties` can be used to include `@ConfigurationProperties` beans.

TIP: A list of the auto-configuration settings that are enabled by `@RestClientTest` can be xref:test-auto-configuration.adoc[found in the appendix].

The specific beans that you want to test should be specified by using the `value` or `components` attribute of `@RestClientTest`, as shown in the following example:
