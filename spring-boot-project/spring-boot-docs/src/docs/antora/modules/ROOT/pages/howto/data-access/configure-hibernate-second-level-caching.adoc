= Configure Hibernate Second-Level Caching

Hibernate {hibernate-docs}#caching[second-level cache] can be configured for a range of cache providers.
Rather than configuring Hibernate to lookup the cache provider again, it is better to provide the one that is available in the context whenever possible.

To do this with JCache, first make sure that `org.hibernate.orm:hibernate-jcache` is available on the classpath.
Then, add a `HibernatePropertiesCustomizer` bean as shown in the following example:

include::code:MyHibernateSecondLevelCacheConfiguration[]

This customizer will configure Hibernate to use the same `CacheManager` as the one that the application uses.
It is also possible to use separate `CacheManager` instances.
For details, see {hibernate-docs}#caching-provider-jcache[the Hibernate user guide].
