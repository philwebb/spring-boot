= Accessing Application Arguments
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

If you need to access the application arguments that were passed to `SpringApplication.run(...)`, you can inject a `org.springframework.boot.ApplicationArguments` bean.
The `ApplicationArguments` interface provides access to both the raw `String[]` arguments as well as parsed `option` and `non-option` arguments, as shown in the following example:

include::code:MyBean[]

TIP: Spring Boot also registers a `CommandLinePropertySource` with the Spring `Environment`.
This lets you also inject single application arguments by using the `@Value` annotation.
