= Create WebSocket Endpoints Using @ServerEndpoint

If you want to use `@ServerEndpoint` in a Spring Boot application that used an embedded container, you must declare a single `ServerEndpointExporter` `@Bean`, as shown in the following example:

include::code:MyWebSocketConfiguration[]

The bean shown in the preceding example registers any `@ServerEndpoint` annotated beans with the underlying WebSocket container.
When deployed to a standalone servlet container, this role is performed by a servlet container initializer, and the `ServerEndpointExporter` bean is not required.
