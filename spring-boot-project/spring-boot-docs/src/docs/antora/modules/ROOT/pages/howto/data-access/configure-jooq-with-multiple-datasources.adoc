= Configure jOOQ with Two DataSources

If you need to use jOOQ with multiple data sources, you should create your own `DSLContext` for each one.
See {spring-boot-autoconfigure-module-code}/jooq/JooqAutoConfiguration.java[JooqAutoConfiguration] for more details.

TIP: In particular, `JooqExceptionTranslator` and `SpringTransactionProvider` can be reused to provide similar features to what the auto-configuration does with a single `DataSource`.
