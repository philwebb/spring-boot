= Importing Extensionless Files

Some cloud platforms cannot add a file extension to volume mounted files.
To import these extensionless files, you need to give Spring Boot a hint so that it knows how to load them.
You can do this by putting an extension hint in square brackets.

For example, suppose you have a `/etc/config/myconfig` file that you wish to import as yaml.
You can import it from your `application.properties` using the following:

[source,yaml,indent=0,subs="verbatim",configprops,configblocks]
----
	spring:
	  config:
	    import: "file:/etc/config/myconfig[.yaml]"
----
