Hopefully, this section provided some of the Spring Boot basics and got you on your way to writing your own applications.
If you are a task-oriented type of developer, you might want to jump over to https://spring.io and follow some of the https://spring.io/guides/[getting started] guides that solve specific "`How do I do that with Spring?`" problems.
We also have Spring Boot-specific "`xref:howto.adoc[How-to]`" reference documentation.

Otherwise, the next logical step is to read _xref:using.adoc[Developing with Spring Boot]_.
If you are really impatient, you could also jump ahead and read about _xref:features.adoc[Spring Boot features]_.
