= Encrypting Properties
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

Spring Boot does not provide any built in support for encrypting property values, however, it does provide the hook points necessary to modify values contained in the Spring `Environment`.
The `EnvironmentPostProcessor` interface allows you to manipulate the `Environment` before the application starts.
See xref:howto/application.adoc#application.customize-the-environment-or-application-context[Customize the Environment or ApplicationContext Before It Starts] for details.

If you need a secure way to store credentials and passwords, the https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-vault/[Spring Cloud Vault] project provides support for storing externalized configuration in https://www.vaultproject.io/[HashiCorp Vault].
