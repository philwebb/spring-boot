= Encrypting Properties

Spring Boot does not provide any built in support for encrypting property values, however, it does provide the hook points necessary to modify values contained in the Spring `Environment`.
The `EnvironmentPostProcessor` interface allows you to manipulate the `Environment` before the application starts.
See <<howto#howto.application.customize-the-environment-or-application-context>> for details.

If you need a secure way to store credentials and passwords, the https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-vault/[Spring Cloud Vault] project provides support for storing externalized configuration in https://www.vaultproject.io/[HashiCorp Vault].
