= File Rotation

If you are using the Logback, it is possible to fine-tune log rotation settings using your `application.properties` or `application.yaml` file.
For all other logging system, you will need to configure rotation settings directly yourself (for example, if you use Log4j2 then you could add a `log4j2.xml` or `log4j2-spring.xml` file).

The following rotation policy properties are supported:

|===

| The filename pattern used to create log archives.

| configprop:logging.logback.rollingpolicy.clean-history-on-start[]

| configprop:logging.logback.rollingpolicy.max-file-size[]
