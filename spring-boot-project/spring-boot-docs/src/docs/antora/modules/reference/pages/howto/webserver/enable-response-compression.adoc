= Enable HTTP Response Compression

HTTP response compression is supported by Jetty, Tomcat, Reactor Netty, and Undertow.
It can be enabled in `application.properties`, as follows:

[configprops,yaml]
----
	server:
	  compression:
	    enabled: true
----

By default, responses must be at least 2048 bytes in length for compression to be performed.
You can configure this behavior by setting the configprop:server.compression.min-response-size[] property.

By default, responses are compressed only if their content type is one of the following:

* `text/html`
* `text/xml`
* `text/plain`
* `text/css`
* `text/javascript`
* `application/javascript`
* `application/json`
* `application/xml`

You can configure this behavior by setting the configprop:server.compression.mime-types[] property.
