:page-section-summary-toc: 1

If the `SpringApplication` defaults are not to your taste, you can instead create a local instance and customize it.
For example, to turn off the banner, you could write:

include-code::./MyApplication[]

NOTE: The constructor arguments passed to `SpringApplication` are configuration sources for Spring beans.
In most cases, these are references to `@Configuration` classes, but they could also be direct references `@Component` classes.

It is also possible to configure the `SpringApplication` by using an `application.properties` file.
See _xref:features/external-config.adoc[Externalized Configuration]_ for details.

For a complete list of the configuration options, see the {spring-boot-module-api}/SpringApplication.html[`SpringApplication` Javadoc].
