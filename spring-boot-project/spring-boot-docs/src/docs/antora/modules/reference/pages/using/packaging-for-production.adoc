Executable jars can be used for production deployment.
As they are self-contained, they are also ideally suited for cloud-based deployment.

For additional "`production ready`" features, such as health, auditing, and metric REST or JMX end-points, consider adding `spring-boot-actuator`.
See _xref:howto/actuator.adoc[Actuator]_ for details.
