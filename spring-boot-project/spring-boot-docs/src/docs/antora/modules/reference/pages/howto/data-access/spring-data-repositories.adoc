= Use Spring Data Repositories
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

Spring Data can create implementations of `@Repository` interfaces of various flavors.
Spring Boot handles all of that for you, as long as those `@Repositories` are included in the same package (or a sub-package) of your `@EnableAutoConfiguration` class.

For many applications, all you need is to put the right Spring Data dependencies on your classpath.
There is a `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` for JPA, `spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb` for Mongodb, and various other starters for supported technologies.
To get started, create some repository interfaces to handle your `@Entity` objects.

Spring Boot tries to guess the location of your `@Repository` definitions, based on the `@EnableAutoConfiguration` it finds.
To get more control, use the `@EnableJpaRepositories` annotation (from Spring Data JPA).
