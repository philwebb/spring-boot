[[native-image.advanced.nested-configuration-properties]]
=== Nested Configuration Properties

Reflection hints are automatically created for configuration properties.
Nested configuration properties however *must* be annotated with `@NestedConfigurationProperty`, otherwise they won't be detected and will not be bindable.

include::code:MyProperties[]

The preceding example produces configuration properties for `my.properties.name` and `my.properties.nested.number`.
Without the `@NestedConfigurationProperty` annotation on the `nested` field the `my.properties.nested.number` property would not be bindable in a native image.

NOTE: Please use public getters / setters, otherwise the properties won't be bindable.

[[native-image.advanced.custom-hints]]
=== Custom hints

If you need to provide your own hints for reflection, resources, serialization, proxy usage etc. you can use a Spring provided API for that:

include::code:MyRuntimeHints[]

You can then use `@ImportRuntimeHints` on any `@Configuration` class (for example your `@SpringBootApplication` annotated application class) to activate those hints.

[[native-image.advanced.custom-hints.testing]]
==== Testing custom hints

`RuntimeHintsPredicates` can be used to test your hints:

include::code:MyRuntimeHintsTests[]

[[native-image.advanced.known-limitations]]
=== Known Limitations

GraalVM Native Images are an evolving technology and not all libraries provide support.
The GraalVM community is helping by providing https://github.com/oracle/graalvm-reachability-metadata[reachability metadata] for projects that don't yet ship their own.

If you encounter problems when generating native images for Spring Boot applications, please check the {github-wiki}/Known-GraalVM-Native-Image-Limitations[Known GraalVM Native Image Limitations] of the Spring Boot wiki.
You can also contribute issues to the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-aot-smoke-tests[spring-aot-smoke-tests] project on GitHub which is used to confirm that common application types are working as expected.
